You can change these values to ajust the process.

Example 1

     int N =4;
     int CoefsN =128;
     int KSVD_Depth =2;

Example 2

     int N =2;
     int CoefsN =3;
     int KSVD_Depth =3;
     
Example 3

     int N =8;
     int CoefsN =64;
     int KSVD_Depth =64;     
     
Example 4

     int N =8;
     int CoefsN =16;
     int KSVD_Depth =16;
